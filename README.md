<h1>Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming </h1>
<p>
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at Alx School. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. These section is about debugging argv and argc header file The specific list of projects contained as follows:
</p>

<a>• 0x00. C - Hello, World </a> </ br>
<a>• 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while </a>
• 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
• 0x03. C - More functions, more nested loops
• 0x04. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
• 0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
• 0x06. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
• 0x07. C - Recursion
• 0x08. C - Static libraries
• 0x09. C - argc, argv
• 0x0A. C - malloc, free
• 0x0B. C - More malloc, free
• 0x0C. C - Preprocessor
• 0x0D. C - Structures, typedef
• 0x0E. C - Function pointers
• 0x0F. C - Variadic functions
• 0x10. C - printf
• 0x11. C - Singly linked lists
• 0x12. C - More singly linked lists
• 0x13. C - Bit manipulation
• 0x14. C - File I/O
• 0x15. C - Simple Shell
• 0x16. C - Doubly linked lists
• 0x17. C - Dynamic libraries
• 0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
• 0x19. C - Hash tables
• 0x1A. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
• 0x1B. C - Makefiles
